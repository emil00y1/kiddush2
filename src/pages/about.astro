    <div class="max800 intro">
      <p>Kiddush started as a wineclub in 2021 and has, since then developed into a beer breweri. We are producing the beer ourselves in our little breweri in the Northern region of Zealand.<p/> 
        <br>
      <p>Our passion for brewing beer stems from our desire to bring people together and create a sense of community. We believe that there's something special about sharing a pint of delicious, locally-brewed beer with friends and loved ones, and
        that's what drives us to keep experimenting and perfecting our craft.

      <img class="jacob_img" src="/img/portraitjacob.webp" alt="potrait of co-owner, Jacob" />
      <p class="place_right">
        Jacob is 24 years old and started Kiddush in 2021 . It all began when Jacob got tired of everything being so fancy while working as a cellare. Gathering people around good beer for a reasonable price became a misson.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jacob has a good sense for graphic design and does’nt put anything in production that he can’t stand by. A thouroughly developed product from beginning to end is the most important thing for Jakob as co-owner of Kiddush.

      <p class="place_left">
        Lucas is 25 years old and grew up in Østerbro, Copenhagen. Good food and a healthy thirst has always been a part of Lucas’ persona. With a passion for brewing and a knack for experimentation, he brings a unique and creative perspective to the
        brewery's operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        His dedication to quality ensures that every sip of Kiddush beer is a delight for the taste buds, and his enthusiasm for community-building makes him a natural fit for the company's mission.
